# Schro-horse
from Jayden:
I think the model may be working now but I haven't got a way to test it yet so it could be not updating the weights or something idk- will investigate tomorrow.

Currently it only works with 1 ticker- also aiming to fix tomorrow.

Tomorrow morning i'll make some bits to load the data and params back into the qiskit circuit so everyone can use it.

theres probably loads of issues still and its been very painful process to get something that appears to train, but making progress!
## Dependencies

`pip install qiskit==2.1.0`

and latest versions of pennylane (Quantum machine learning library that makes it compatible with tensorflow training)
