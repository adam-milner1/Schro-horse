    "## Market Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Market simulation is the process of creating computational models that mimic the behavior of financial markets. Instead of predicting a single outcome, simulations generate multiple possible scenarios for asset prices, trading volumes, and market dynamics. These simulations help analysts, traders, and researchers to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand potential risks and market behaviors.\n",
    "- Test trading strategies under diverse conditions.\n",
    "- Explore the impact of economic events or policy changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern approaches often use stochastic models, agent-based systems, or generative techniques to produce realistic price paths. By simulating a variety of market scenarios, we can gain insights into volatility, correlations, and emergent patterns that are difficult to capture through historical data alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Value of Market Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Market simulation provides financial institutions with the ability to explore and analyze **possible future scenarios** without risking real capital. Improved simulation models translate directly into actionable business value:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Risk Management:**  \n",
    "  Simulating a wide range of market conditions allows banks and asset managers to identify potential vulnerabilities, stress-test portfolios, and set capital reserves more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strategy Testing:**  \n",
    "  Traders can evaluate trading strategies under diverse and realistic market conditions before deploying them, reducing exposure to unexpected market events.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Portfolio Optimization:**  \n",
    "  Generating accurate multi-asset scenarios enables better understanding of correlations and diversification benefits, leading to more robust portfolio construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regulatory Compliance:**  \n",
    "  Financial regulators often require stress tests and scenario analyses; more realistic simulations make these assessments more credible and actionable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decision Support & Forecasting:**  \n",
    "  Improved models provide probabilistic insights into potential market outcomes, supporting more informed strategic and investment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Competitive Advantage:**  \n",
    "  Firms that can model markets with higher fidelity can anticipate rare events, capture subtle correlations, and respond faster to volatility, gaining an edge over competitors relying on traditional methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "By capturing complex stochastic behaviors and correlations that classical models often miss, advanced market simulations—especially those leveraging quantum or generative techniques—allow financial institutions to **make smarter, faster, and safer decisions** in an inherently uncertain environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations of Classical Methods in Capturing Market Randomness\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical financial models, such as ARIMA, GARCH, and Monte Carlo simulations, rely on predefined statistical assumptions about market behavior. While these methods are useful for approximating trends and volatility, they often struggle to fully incorporate the inherent randomness of real-world markets. Key limitations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplifying assumptions:** Many classical models assume normal distributions, linear relationships, or stationary processes, which fail to capture fat tails, sudden shocks, or regime shifts.\n",
    "- **Limited scenario diversity:** Classical simulations generate a constrained set of possible futures, often underestimating rare but impactful events.\n",
    "- **Sequential dependencies:** Traditional methods model randomness sequentially, which may not capture complex correlations between multiple assets or market variables simultaneously.\n",
    "- **Scalability issues:** Modeling a high-dimensional market with many interacting factors quickly becomes computationally expensive, limiting the granularity of randomness that can be realistically simulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations motivate the exploration of alternative approaches, such as **quantum generative models**, which can inherently encode complex probability distributions and capture richer stochastic behavior in market simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantum approaches to Market Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Several quantum computing techniques have been explored for market simulation, leveraging the natural probabilistic behavior of quantum systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantum Generative Models (QGANs, QCBMs):**  \n",
    "  Variational circuits are trained to generate distributions of asset prices, capturing complex correlations and stochastic behavior beyond classical approximations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantum Amplitude Encoding & Sampling:**  \n",
    "  Market states can be encoded into quantum amplitudes, allowing efficient sampling of high-dimensional probability distributions for scenario generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variational Quantum Algorithms for Stochastic Processes:**  \n",
    "  Parameterized quantum circuits model temporal dynamics of assets, approximating stochastic processes such as Geometric Brownian Motion or jump-diffusion models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantum Boltzmann Machines:**  \n",
    "  Useful for learning joint distributions of multiple assets, enabling the generation of correlated price trajectories that reflect market dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Monte Carlo:**  \n",
    "  Quantum circuits provide fast sampling of probability distributions, which are combined with classical Monte Carlo methods for risk analysis and scenario simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These approaches exploit quantum parallelism and entanglement to model complex market dynamics that are challenging for classical methods.\n",

    "Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) are the quantum analogue of classical GANs, designed to model complex probability distributions using quantum circuits. A typical QGAN consists of:\n",

They are particularly suitable for simulating systems with complex correlations and randomness, such as financial markets, where classical models often struggle.\n",

    "# Market-Centric Approach to QGANs\n",
    "\n",
    "In our approach, the QGAN is specifically designed to reflect the structure of financial markets. Unlike generic QGANs, our **quantum generator leverages the correlations between stocks** to guide qubit interactions, ensuring that generated price scenarios capture realistic market dependencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also propose a unique data encoding design - which is aimed at keeping asset information on the same qubits. This prevents potentially uncorrelated data from entangling and causing additional noise within the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correlation-Based Qubit Linkages:**  \n",
    "  Qubits representing different assets are entangled based on historical correlation data. Highly correlated stocks have stronger entanglement, allowing the quantum generator to naturally model joint price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Novel Data Encoding:**  \n",
    "  We encode same asset data on the same neighboring qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantum Generator Design:**  \n",
    "  The parameterised quantum circuit (PQC) uses entanglement patterns informed by market relationships. Measurement outcomes correspond to simulated asset price scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Discriminator:**  \n",
    "  A classical discriminator evaluates the realism of generated price paths, guiding the generator to produce distributions that match historical statistical properties, including volatility and cross-asset correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Market-Aware Sampling:**  \n",
    "  By encoding market structure directly into the generator, the QGAN produces scenario distributions that reflect realistic dependencies between assets, rather than treating each stock independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- Captures complex multi-asset correlations more accurately than generic QGANs.\n",
    "- Produces more realistic stochastic price paths for risk analysis, portfolio optimisation, and strategy testing.  \n",
    "- Integrates domain knowledge (market correlations) directly into the quantum model, bridging financial expertise and quantum generative capabilities.\n"
